space/
    112-234/
        profile.txt <- structured file, e.g.
            Name

            Password
            Description
            ...


1. Move to any given pair of coordinates (x,y) -> ./space/112-234/
2. Teleport to any free space coordinates + create planet + capture
3. Any free planet could be captured:
    - Give Name, Description, Password
    - Description is a secret and could be viewed only after correct password auth
4. User can list all his planets (./users/name/planets.txt)

* Ensure that nobody could capture all the planets
    -> Unlimited space?

(!) Possible vulnerabilities
1) Find a planet (?) -> rewrite public field to break file structure and rewrite password -> get secrets
2) "File path modification on register": find a user (??) -> register with filepath name (shit/../old) -> override password





Users:
./users/name/password.txt

register
vasya/../petya
password

-> listing
petya
alice

f = fopen("./users/vasya/../petya/password.txt", "w")
fputs(f, password)
fclose(f)
